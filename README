Welcome to the Crunchbang Python Group's
group project in Python.  

The main program dungeons.py requires
libtcod-1.5.1. which can be freely downloaded at:
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/download/

The Crunchbang Python Group is honestly just simple post on a forum
located at http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=26914&p=1
and are in NO way affiliated with Crunchbang Linux, Corenominal, the
Crunchbang distribution process, or any other implied projects.
We simply love Crunchbang and happen to use the forums a lot.

The Crunchbang Python Group is:
